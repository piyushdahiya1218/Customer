# Customer
(This Customer app is part of the project. Have a look at the Vendor app here - https://github.com/piyushdahiya1218/Vendor)

This app is targeted for users who don't want to step out of their home everytime they need fruits and vegetables but still want to support local street vendors instead of ordering groceries from Instamart or Dunzo!

Aim is to provide convenience to customers who want to buy fruits or vegetables from their local street vendor at the comfort of their home. Customers can locate nearby vendors in the map, request them an order with specified quantity and price, bargain online and compare prices between vendors all from within this app. Customers can only see those vendors in the map who have set their visibility as ON.

When the customer orders from a vendor, an order request notification is sent to the vendor, if they accept the request, customer can see vendor's real time location in the map along with order summary.
